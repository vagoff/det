----

DET's Highlights:
* NEVER backtracks! (i.e., fully deterministic)
* unlimited lookahead (using stages)
* easy to use (no annoying tree traversing anymore)
* very explicit and predictable
* allows to generate IR from source directly (look, ma, no AST!)
* language agnostic (works everywhere from haskell and prolog to c++ and javascript)
* allows to apply arbitrary (including stateful) transformations on IR construction side (altrough not recommended)
+ statically known stack consumption
+ static detection of inifinite loops
+ automatically proves equivalence with BNF counterpart (!!!)
